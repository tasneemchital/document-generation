# Document Generation Web Application

A React-based document generation platform that transforms CMS content into structured, reusable language snippets with document composition capabilities.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Efficient** - Streamlined workflow from CMS data to finished documents with minimal friction
2. **Structured** - Clear organization of content snippets with logical hierarchies and relationships
3. **Professional** - Clean, business-focused interface that inspires confidence in document quality

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Manages CMS data fetching, snippet organization, and document composition with persistent user preferences

## Essential Features

### CMS Data Integration
- **Functionality**: Fetch and display content from latest CMS models
- **Purpose**: Provide fresh, up-to-date content as source material for document generation
- **Trigger**: App initialization and manual refresh actions
- **Progression**: Load CMS data → Parse into structured format → Display in organized interface → Ready for snippet creation
- **Success criteria**: CMS content loads reliably and displays in organized, searchable format

### Content Snippet Creation
- **Functionality**: Break CMS content into small, reusable language snippets with metadata
- **Purpose**: Create modular content building blocks for flexible document composition
- **Trigger**: User selects CMS content and chooses "Create Snippet" action
- **Progression**: Select content → Define snippet metadata (tags, category) → Save to snippet library → Available for document use
- **Success criteria**: Users can create, edit, and organize snippets efficiently

### Document Composition
- **Functionality**: Combine snippets into complete documents with custom structure
- **Purpose**: Generate professional documents from existing content building blocks
- **Trigger**: User starts new document creation workflow
- **Progression**: Create document → Add snippets via drag/drop or selection → Arrange and edit → Preview → Export/save
- **Success criteria**: Documents can be composed, edited, and exported in multiple formats

### Snippet Management
- **Functionality**: Search, filter, categorize, and organize content snippets
- **Purpose**: Maintain an efficient library system for content reuse
- **Trigger**: User accesses snippet library
- **Progression**: Browse snippets → Filter by category/tags → Search by content → Select for use or editing
- **Success criteria**: Users can quickly find and manage their snippet collection

## Edge Case Handling
- **CMS Connection Failure**: Display cached content with clear offline indicators and retry options
- **Empty Snippet Library**: Show onboarding flow guiding users to create their first snippets
- **Large Document Export**: Implement progressive loading and export status indicators
- **Duplicate Content**: Detect and offer merge options for similar snippets
- **Browser Storage Limits**: Implement cleanup workflows and cloud sync options

## Design Direction
The design should feel professional and efficient like modern business software - think Notion or Figma's clean interfaces - with emphasis on content clarity and workflow optimization over flashy visuals.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - using a sophisticated blue-orange pairing to create clear visual hierarchy between content areas and actions while maintaining professional credibility.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (oklch(0.45 0.15 240)) - communicates trust, professionalism, and stability for primary actions
- **Secondary Colors**: Light Blue (oklch(0.85 0.08 240)) for backgrounds and Charcoal (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) for secondary text
- **Accent Color**: Warm Orange (oklch(0.65 0.15 45)) - attention-grabbing highlight for CTAs and important elements like "Generate Document"
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White oklch(1 0 0)): Charcoal text (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) - Ratio 12.6:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Blue oklch(0.95 0.03 240)): Charcoal text (oklch(0.25 0.02 240)) - Ratio 11.8:1 ✓
  - Primary (Deep Blue oklch(0.45 0.15 240)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓
  - Accent (Warm Orange oklch(0.65 0.15 45)): White text (oklch(1 0 0)) - Ratio 4.8:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Clean, highly readable sans-serif typography that conveys technical precision and modern professionalism - Inter for its excellent readability at all sizes and comprehensive character set.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (App Title): Inter Bold/32px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/24px/normal spacing  
  - H3 (Card Titles): Inter Medium/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Content): Inter Regular/16px/relaxed line height
  - Caption (Metadata): Inter Regular/14px/muted color

## Animations
Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance workflow efficiency without distraction - focus on smooth state transitions and clear feedback for user actions.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Quick micro-interactions (200ms) for button states, smooth card transitions for content organization, and progress indicators for document generation
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Primary focus on snippet selection and document composition workflows, minimal decoration elsewhere

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Card for snippet display, Dialog for document creation, Form for snippet editing, Button variants for different action types, Input for search, Badge for tags, Separator for content organization
- **Customizations**: Custom snippet preview component, document composition canvas, CMS data visualization cards
- **States**: Hover states for interactive cards, loading states for CMS fetching, success states for document generation, focus states for form inputs
- **Icon Selection**: Plus for creation, Search for filtering, Download for export, Edit for modification, Folder for organization
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4-unit (16px) grid for major layout, 2-unit (8px) for component internal spacing
- **Mobile**: Responsive cards that stack vertically, collapsible sidebar for snippet library, touch-friendly button sizes for mobile document editing
