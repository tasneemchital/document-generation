### Essential Files to Include

**README.md Template:**
```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description of your UI application.

## Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm run dev`

## Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/ui Components
- Vite

## Contributing
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
```

**CONTRIBUTING.md:**
```markdown
# Contributing Guide

## Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Test thoroughly
5. Submit a pull request

## Code Standards
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow existing component patterns
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Include tests for new features
```

## Branch Strategy

### GitFlow for UI Development

**Main Branches:**
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features

**Supporting Branches:**
- `feature/`: New features or components
- `bugfix/`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/`: Critical production fixes
- `release/`: Prepare new releases

### Branch Naming Convention
```
feature/add-rule-editing-modal
feature/improve-grid-performance
bugfix/fix-translation-text-overflow
hotfix/critical-data-loss-fix
release/v1.2.0
```

### Example Workflow
```bash
# Start new feature
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop
git checkout -b feature/add-search-functionality

# Work on feature
# ... make changes ...

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add search functionality to rule grid"
git push origin feature/add-search-functionality

# Create pull request to develop branch
```

## Commit Best Practices

### Conventional Commits
Use structured commit messages for better tracking:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code formatting, no logic changes
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### UI-Specific Examples
```bash
# Adding new components
git commit -m "feat(components): add RuleEditModal component"

# Styling improvements
git commit -m "style(grid): improve responsive layout for mobile"

# Bug fixes
git commit -m "fix(translation): resolve text overflow in grid cells"

# Performance improvements
git commit -m "perf(grid): implement virtual scrolling for large datasets"

# Accessibility improvements
git commit -m "a11y(forms): add proper ARIA labels to input fields"
```
